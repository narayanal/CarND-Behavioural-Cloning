Please check model.ipynb file for histogram

As, there are more images with steering angle 0 and it will add strong bias to go stragiht.

The steps I have taken to solve this issue is:

Read the entire data set, if the steering angle is zero, only consider 20% data of it.
I have achieved it using random generator function.

Please check the following code snippet.

def add_image_to_set(img, y): 
    skip = 0
    rand = np.random.randint(100) 
    if abs( y ) == 0.0 and rand < 80 :
     skip = 1
    else:
     features.append(img)
     labels.append(y)
    return skip
