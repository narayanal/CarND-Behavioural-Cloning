Project details:

Data collection:
I have tried collecting the data using simulator. 
But I have used the udacity data set for training the model.

Pre-processing:
I have used all the 3 images from the dataset (left, right, center) and by adding shift in steering angle
Used the left:right:center images with ratio 1:1:2 and randomly choosing the images. check the function random_load_images.

The intial data contains, steering angle with more number of zeros.
To counter this, I have considered only 0.2 percentage of data containing zero steering angle and ignored other data.

Data augmentation:
I have augmented data using the techniques of Flip, adjust brightness, transform images and adjusted the steering angle accordingly.

Training model:
I have tried Comma.ai model and Nvidia model.
Nvidia model has given better results than Comma.ai model

Lessons learnt:
Intially I tried, training the model with out cropping the image, assuming model should be able to train the things. 
In the autonomous mode, i was never able to complete the track.

But later, I have realised, cropping the image, according to the area of interest is very important.
This is very important.
It helped me to train the model faster and also it produced better results and the autonomous car able to complete the track.
